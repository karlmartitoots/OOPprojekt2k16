    KARL:
    I was considering using this kind of config for the generals:
    private GeneralCard player1general;
    private GeneralCard player2general;
    private List<GeneralCard> allGenerals = new ArrayList<>(2);

    When we load the gameboard, we load in the generals as well so the players choose
    their generals before the gameboard has been loaded or they are assigned some random generals

    But I'd like your input on this aswell.
